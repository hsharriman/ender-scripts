## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df <- read.csv("./out/study/scores_df.csv")
summary(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# are post test scores explained by being assigned to SA or SB?
t.test(df[df$version == 'A', ]$score, df[df$version == 'B',]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```
```{r}
# Subset the data where problem == "posttest"
df <- subset(df, pilot == 0)
t.test(df[df$version == 'A', ]$score, df[df$version == 'B',]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```
```{r}
df <- read.csv("./out/study/per_question.csv")
summary(df)
```


```{r}
df <- subset(df, pilot == 0)
df <- df[!grepl("^P", df$proof), ]
t.test(df[df$version == 'A', ]$score, df[df$version == 'B',]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
