## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df <- read.csv("./out/study/scores_df.csv")
summary(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# are post test scores explained by being assigned to SA or SB?
t.test(df[df$version == 'A', ]$score, df[df$version == 'B',]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```
```{r}
# Subset the data where problem == "posttest"
df <- subset(df, pilot == 0)
t.test(df[df$version == 'A', ]$score, df[df$version == 'B',]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```
```{r}
df <- read.csv("./out/study/combined2.csv")
df <- subset(df, pilot == 0)
summary(df)
```


```{r}
df <- df[!grepl("^P", df$proof), ]
t.test(df[df$version == 'A', ]$score, df[df$version == 'B',]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```
# Check significance of performance on individual questions
Check significance of performing better on "does this proof have a mistake?" questions
```{r}
t.test(df[df$version == 'A'& df$questionType == 1, ]$score, df[df$version == 'B'& df$questionType == 1,]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```
Check significance of performing better on "which step is wrong?" questions
```{r}
t.test(df[df$version == 'A'& df$questionType == 2, ]$score, df[df$version == 'B'& df$questionType == 1,]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)

t.test(df[df$version == 'A'& df$questionType == 3, ]$score, df[df$version == 'B'& df$questionType == 1,]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```

Check significance of performing better on "must X be congruent to Y?" questions
```{r}
t.test(df[df$version == 'A'& df$questionType == 4, ]$score, df[df$version == 'B'& df$questionType == 4,]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```

Check significance of performing better on "is reason X correctly applied?" questions
```{r}
t.test(df[df$version == 'A'& df$questionType == 5, ]$score, df[df$version == 'B'& df$questionType == 5,]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```


# Filter out rows where reasonCorrect is NA
```{r}
dfR <- df[!is.na(df$reasonCorrect),]
summary(dfR)
t.test(dfR[dfR$version == 'A', ]$reasonCorrect, dfR[dfR$version == 'B',]$reasonCorrect, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```

# Filter out rows where reasonCorrect is NA
```{r}
t.test(dfR[dfR$version == 'A' & dfR$reasonCorrect == 0, ]$score, dfR[dfR$version == 'B' & dfR$reasonCorrect == 0,]$score, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
